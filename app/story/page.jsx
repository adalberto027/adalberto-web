          <p className="mt-6 text-lg text-white/80">
          I am a Computer Science student at the University of Texas at El Paso, passionate about leveraging technology to drive 
          innovation. My journey into programming began at 12 when I taught myself web development and JavaScript through online 
          resources. Since then, I have gained hands-on experience through internships at NASA, Microsoft, and participation in 
          Google's Tech Exchange program, where I honed my skills in software development, data structures, and analytics. Despite 
          balancing academics with professional opportunities and financial challenges, I have excelled by focusing on impactful projects 
          and continuous learning. My future goals include pursuing advanced studies in Artificial Intelligence and contributing to 
          transformative technological advancements.
